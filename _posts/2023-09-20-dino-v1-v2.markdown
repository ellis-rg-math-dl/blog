In this meeting we discussed the self-supervised learning of vision transformers.
First half of the presentation was based on the 2021 paper ["Emerging Properties in Self-Supervised Vision Transformers"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14294.pdf).
Second half was about the second version of DINO based on the 2023 paper ["DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features
without Supervision"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.07193.pdf).
