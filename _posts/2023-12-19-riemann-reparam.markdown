While reparametrizations and symmetries cause a lot of confusion in the investigation of neural networks' behaviour people did not yet look at it from the perspective of differential geometry.
Presented by Agustinus Kristiadi NeurIPS23 paper ["The geometry of neural nets' parameter spaces under reparametrization"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.07384.pdf)
fills this blank and shows how using proper Riemannian geometry can help to avoid confusion in such aspects as computation of gradients, flatness or density fitting under reparametrizations.
