David Yunis has demonstrated the perspectives on understanding deep learning theoretically from the perspective 
of spectral dynamics of weight matrices. Such approach allows to get insights about way the networks make 
predictions, trained, when they are connected with a line without loss barrier (LMC phenomenon) and much more.
Full work and empirical results is in this [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11804).
