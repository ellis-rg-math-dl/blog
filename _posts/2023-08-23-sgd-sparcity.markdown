We discussed the simplicity bias of SGD with large step sizes in this meeting with Maksym Andriushchenko.
The presentation was based on the ICML2023 paper ["SGD with Large Step Sizes Learns Sparse Features"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05337.pdf).
In particular, we discussed the models for which the sparsity of activations can be proven rigorously, and how this can be extended to real-world models and datasets.
The research was put into the perspective of the similar works that show simplicity of the models obtained with SGD.
